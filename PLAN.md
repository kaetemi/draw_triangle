# Plan

We're making a game! #NoEngine

Here's the plan:

1. Open a window
2. Draw a triangle
3. ???
4. Profit!

This file will be kept up-to-date.

## Sound

For sound, OpenAL "will do". :(

## Input

For controls, better to use XInput directly.

## Event loop

Simply push the game update function into the loop, then run the event loop until flushed.
